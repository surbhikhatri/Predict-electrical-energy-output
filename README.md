# Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set
The dataset contains data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over
6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features
consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP),
Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical
energy output (EP) of the plant.

The tasks involve data exploration, creating scatterplots, calculating statistical measures, conducting **simple and multiple linear regressions**, investigating nonlinear associations, and assessing interactions among predictors. Additionally, attempts are made to improve the model using interaction terms or nonlinear associations, and k-nearest neighbor regression is employed. The project combines statistical analysis, regression modeling, and machine learning techniques to gain insights into the power plant's operational dynamics.
